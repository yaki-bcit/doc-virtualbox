# Install VirtualBox
{: .no_toc }

In this section, you will learn how to get and install the latest version of VirtualBox for Windows.

The download size is approximately 100 MB, and depending on your internet connection speed, it may take from 1 to 10 minutes on most modern connections.

Installation time mostly depends on the type of your storage, although other specifications may also play a minor role.

> **Warning**: The installation involves changes to some deep system settings and creation of virtual hardware such as network adapters. As such, **your computer WILL require a full reboot** after installation. Before you start the installation, **make sure to save and close any open files and close unnecessary programs**.
