# Create an Ubuntu Virtual Machine
{: .no_toc }

This section shows how to download an Ubuntu installation disk image, how to add a new virtual machine (VM) in VirtualBox and how to install Ubuntu inside the VM.

> **Warning**: Please make sure to have at least 10-15 GB of free space on your system before you proceed. Operating system disk images range between 1.5 and 4.5 GB in size, and once installed, your new virtual machine will take additional 8 to 12 GB of disk space.
